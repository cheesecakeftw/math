## [Distributive property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_property)

Definition: Given a set $S$, and two binary operations $\ast$ and $+$ on $S$, the operation $\ast$ is distributive over $+$, if $\ast$ is commutative and $x\ast (y+z)=x\ast y + y\ast z$.

The earliest example of this property is something we see in school where we learn $a\ast (b+c)= a\ast b + a\ast c$ where $a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z} $ which is formally called multiplication distributes over addition.

This definition allows us to define a [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)) which is a set that consists of two binary operations: addition and multiplication, such that the ring is an [abelian group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group) (commutative, associative, has an additive identity and additive inverse) with respect to addition, and a [monoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid) (associative and has an identity element) with respect to multiplication, and $\ast$ distributes over +. If a set $R$ satisfies all of these properties we call $R$ a ring.

Note that we defined a ring to be commutative with respect to addition but not multiplication. If a ring is commutative over multiplication such it is called a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring). Examples of commutative rings include the integers, the polynomials which all behave like numbers in ways that they can be added, subtracted and multiplied in expected ways. A noncommutative ring that we have hinted on before is the matrix ring of n by n matrices where we have shown earlier that multiplication isn't commutative. Note that a ring has an additive inverse because it is an abelian group over addition.

Another important commutative ring is a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)). A field is a commutative ring where $0\neq 1$ and all nonzero elements have a multiplicative inverse. In a ring 0 is the additive identity and 1 is the multiplicative identity, and multiplication distributes over addition. An example of a field is the set of Real numbers. Try to think of others!
