## [Primitive Element Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_element_theorem)

Definition: According to the theorem: every finite separable field extension is generated by a single element.

Wow! This definition seems pretty complicated. Let us start from the beginning with an example. Consider the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$, the smallest ring containing both $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$. Now you may be wondering if there's any number $a\in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$ such that $\mathbb{Q}(a)=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$. Note that is basically an element that [generates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subring#Subring_generated_by_a_set) all of the ring. Consider $a=\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}$. Computing powers of $a$ we get $a^2=(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})^2=5+2\sqrt{6}$ and $a^3=(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})^3=11\sqrt{2}+9\sqrt{3}$. From these we can express $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$ in terms of $a$: $\sqrt{2}=\tfrac{1}{2}(a^3-9a)$ and $\sqrt{3}=-\tfrac{1}{2}(a^3-11a)$. Hence both $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$ belong to $\mathbb{Q}(a)$ and clearly $a\in\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$. Hence, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})=\mathbb{Q}(a)$ where $a=\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}$ is the primitive element.

Generalizing what we just observed: if $F$ is a subfield of $E$, then for any elements $a,b\in E$, the field $F(a,b)$ can be written as $F(a+cb)$ for some $c\in F$. To see why consider an arbitrary $c\in F$ and let $L=F(a,b)$ and $K=F(a+cb)$. Let $f(x),g(x)\in F[x]$ be the minimal polynomials of $a$ and $b$ over $F$ respectively. Define $h(x)=f(a+cb-cx)\in K[x]$ such that $h(b)=0$. Let $p(x)\in K[x]$ denote the minimal polynomial of $b$ over $K$. Since both $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are in $K[x]$ and share $b$ as a root each must be a multiple of $p(x)$ in $K[x]$.

Now we know that a chosen value of $c$ fails to work precisely when $L\neq K$. In that case $b\notin K$ because if $b\in K$ then $a=(a+cb)-cb\in K$ as well, which implies $L=K$. Hence, whenever $L\neq K$ the minimal polynomial $p(x)$ of $b$ over $K$ must have degree such that its at least $2$. It cannot be of the form $(x-b)^n$ since then it would not lie in $K[x]$. Therefore consider another root $\alpha$ of $p(x)$ distinct from $b$. Let $\beta = a+cb-c\alpha$, so that $f(\beta)=0$ and $g(\alpha)=0$. We also have $c=(\beta-a)/(b-\alpha)$. Because $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ each have only finitely many roots there are only finitely many such “bad” values of $c\in F$ that make this happen. Hence except for finitely many values we know that there will exist some $c\in F$ such that $F(a,b)=F(a+cb)$. Note that this argument relies on the fact that the extensions generated by $a,b$ are [separable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_extension) over $F$, which means that their minimal polynomials have distinct roots as we showed earlier.

Now let us tie this back the theorem. For any finite field extension $L/K$, the Primitive Element Theorem guarantees that there exists some $\theta\in L$ such that $L=K(\theta)$. If $\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\}$ is a basis of $L$ over $K$, we can apply the argument above repeatedly to obtain $L=K(a_1+c_2a_2+\cdots+c_na_n)$ for some chosen constants $c_2,\ldots,c_n\in K$. So basically, every finite extension of $K$ inside $\mathbb{C}$ is [simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_extension)!
