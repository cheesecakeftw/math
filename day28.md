## [Ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory))

Definition: In some ring $R$ an ideal subset $I$ of $R$ is a subgroup of the additive group of $R$ such that if $a,b\in I$, then $a+b\in I$ and if $a,k \in I$ then $ak\in I$.

An example of an ideal that we have all seen before is the group of even integers in $\mathbb{Z}$ denoted by $2\mathbb{Z}$. Here the sum of any two even integers $a=2k$, $b=2m$ for $m,k\in \mathbb{Z}$ is even ($a+b=2(m+k)$) and their product ($a\ast b=2(2mk)$) is also even. It is not too difficult to notice that $2\mathbb{Z}$ is a group under addition: an additive subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$. Another example of an ideal is the generalization of our previous example: the set of multiplies of $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ denoted as $\langle n\rangle = n\mathbb{Z} =${$ \{\ldots, -n, 0, n,\ldots\}$}. These ideals are called [principle ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_ideal) which are defined as an ideal that is generated by a single element $a\in R$ through multiplication by every element in $R$. 

Now, consider all the ideals in $\mathbb{Z}$. For any ideal $I \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ either $I=${0} or $I$ has atleast 1 positive element, since it contains the additive inverse of all elements. Let $d$ be the least positive element in $I$ and $a\in J$. Then there exist $q,r$ such that $a=dq+r$ where $0\leq r<d$ by the division algorithm. Then $r=a-dq \in I$ which is lesser than $a$ giving a contradiction. Hence, $r=0$. Then $d$ divides $a$. Then, $I= \langle d\rangle $ which implies that its a Principle ideal. We say that $\mathbb{Z}$ is a [principle ideal domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_ideal_domain) (PID) which is defined as a domain where every ideal is principle. Similar to the proof above we can introduce the definition of the lcm, which says that the lcm is an element of the set of all common multiples which divides all the elements in the set.

Similarly, we can prove that every Euclidean Domain is a PID. In fact, we can also show that every PID is always going to be a [Unique Factorization Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_factorization_domain) (UFD) with a proof that is similar to the proof of unique prime factorization. We will go over that later! This means that the ring $Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ which doesn't have unique prime factorization (Consider $2*3=(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})$) isn't a PID, and hence isn't a Euclidean Domain. Consider $a=1+\sqrt{-5}$ and $b=2$ and their norms and try to perform the division algorithm to see if it holds!
