## [Integral Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_domain)

Definition: A nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero. Hence, $a,b\in R$ and $ab=0 \implies a=0$ or  $b=0$ .

Consider two integers $$a,b$$ such that $ab=0$. Based on what we have learned in school, we can intuitively say that $a=0$ or $b=0$ in the ring $\mathbb{Z}$. but what about other commutative rings?. Consider the ring $\mathbb{Z}_6$ which is the ring of residue classes mod 6 (We will expand on these later). Here, $2*3=0$ but $2,3 \neq 0$.
