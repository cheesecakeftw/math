title: Math Every Day
description: A brief guide to Fun Higher Math
---

Hi! This is the website for Math Every Day. This page will cover one theorem or mathematical idea every day. We will be addressing subjects from game theory all the way through analysis and number theory. Each entry offers a brief overview of the idea and, where relevant, goes over a problem or application.

This guide is NOT a comprehensive reference and is meant only as a quick and fun introduction. **Click the day or topic that you want to read about!**

## Real Analysis (Days 1-7)

### [Day 1: Cauchy Sequences](./day1.html)

$$\forall \varepsilon > 0, \ \exists N \in \mathbb{N} \ \text{such that} \ \forall m,n > N, \ |x_m - x_n| < \varepsilon$$

### [Day 2: Heine Borel Theorem](./day2.html)

$$
\text{A set } X \subseteq \mathbb{R} \text{ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.}
$$

### [Day 3: Limits in functions and sequences](./day3.html)

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = f(x)$$

### [Day 4: Derivative](./day4.html)

$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

### [Day 5: Uniform and Pointwise Convergence](./day5.html)

$$\forall \varepsilon > 0, \ \exists N \ \text{such that} \ \forall n > N, \ \forall x \in U, \ \lvert f_n(x) - f(x) \rvert < \varepsilon$$

### [Day 6: Mean Value Theorem](./day6.html)

$$\exists c \in (a,b) \ \text{such that} \ f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$

### [Day 7: Arzelà–Ascoli theorem](./day7.html)

$$(F \subset R(X),\ \text{bounded and equicontinuous}) \implies \exists \{f_{n_k}\} \to f \text{ uniformly}.$$

## Complex Analysis (Days 8-14)

### [Day 8: Cauchy-Riemann Equations](./day8.html)

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}, \\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}.
$$

### [Day 9: Liouville's Theorem](./day9.html)

$$
\text{A bounded entire function } f : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C} \text{ is constant.}
$$

### [Day 10: Taylor Series](./day10.html)

$$
f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}
a_n(z - z_0)^n, \,\, \,\ a_n=\frac{f^{(n)}(z_0)}{n!}
$$

### [Day 11: Singularities](./day11.html)

$$
\varepsilon > 0,\ B_\varepsilon(z_0) \setminus \{z_0\} \subseteq U \implies z_0 \text{ is an isolated singularity.}
$$

### [Day 12: Contour Integration](./day12.html)

$$\int_\Gamma f(z)\,dz = \int_a^b f\bigl(\gamma(t)\bigr)\,\gamma'(t)\,dt$$

### [Day 12: The Cauchy Integral Theorem](./day13.html)

$$\int_\Gamma f(z)\,dz =0$$
